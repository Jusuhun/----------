## Sequence

It is powered by [js-sequence](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/), which would turn following code block into rendered diagrams:

```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
```



## Flowchart

It is powered by [flowchart.js](http://flowchart.js.org/), which would turn following code block into rendered diagrams:

```flow
st=>start: Start:>http://www.google.com[blank]
e=>end:>http://www.google.com
op1=>operation: My Operation
sub1=>subroutine: My Subroutine
cond=>condition: Yes
or No?:>http://www.google.com
io=>inputoutput: catch something...
para=>parallel: parallel tasks

st->op1->cond
cond(yes)->io->e
cond(no)->para
para(path1, bottom)->sub1(right)->op1
para(path2, top)->op1
```



## Mermaid

Typora also has integration with [mermaid](https://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#mermaid), which supports sequence, flowchart and Gantt.

### Sequence

see [this doc](https://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#sequence-diagrams)

```mermaid
%% Example of sequence diagram
  sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    alt is sick
    Bob->>Alice: Not so good :(
    else is well
    Bob->>Alice: Feeling fresh like a daisy
    end
    opt Extra response
    Bob->>Alice: Thanks for asking
    end
```

### Flowchart

see [this doc](https://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#flowcharts-basic-syntax)

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Hard edge] -->B(Round edge)
    B --> C{Decision}
    C -->|One| D[Result one]
    C -->|Two| E[Result two]
```

### Gantt

see [this doc](https://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#gant-diagrams)

```mermaid
%% Example with selection of syntaxes
        gantt
        dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
        title Adding GANTT diagram functionality to mermaid
